## Stage 6: Building Real-time Projects (Final)

This is the most important and final step to become an Azure Data Engineer. Doing it is the best way to learn it. If you want to become a Data Engineer, start building Data Engineering projects.

I can totally understand if you are an absolute beginner; it might be challenging to grasp the end-to-end functionality of a project. Thatâ€™s the main issue I am trying to solve using my YouTube channel. I want to help people, mostly beginners, by uploading real-time projects. This will greatly help them understand how Data Engineering projects are built in real-time scenarios.

I have already uploaded two videos that cover the end-to-end functionality of an Azure Data
Engineering Project. Start building the project by watching the below two videos.

1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ41WqhHglk&t=88s
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SgHFXXdDBQ&t=1648s (CI/CD)
   After watching and building the projects using the above video, you will have a clear
   understanding of how different Azure data engineering resources are used in real-world projects.
   This will also help you answer questions asked in interviews for the Azure Data Engineering role easily.
   There are also some Azure project videos available on YouTube uploaded by other YouTubers. I
   would strongly recommend watching as many videos as possible and trying to implement them
   in your subscription. This will help you get hands-on experience with different types of projects and receive guidance from different Data Engineer experts. I have provided links to some of the project videos available on YouTube.

   this YT channel)

If you complete all the 6 stages, then you can consider yourself an Intermediate Azure Data
Engineer. You can apply for any Junior to Intermediate level Azure Data Engineering role. The
only final thing you need to concentrate on is to build your resume/CV in a proper way by
including all the required technologies that you learned in the above 6 stages. If you are not a beginner, it would not take a full 6 months to complete all the 6 stages; however, a beginner would need at least 6 months to prepare.
