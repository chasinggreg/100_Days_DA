### Cloud Computing, High Availability, Scalability, Elasticity, Agility, Fault Tolerance, and Disaster Recovery

#### Cloud Computing

Service delivery model over the internet (cloud). This includes but is not limited to:

<ul><li><b>Compute Power</b>  meaning servers such as windows, linux, hosting environments, etc.</li>
<li><b>Storage</b>  like files and/or databases</li>
<li><b>Networking</b>  in azure but also outside when connecting to your company network</li>
<li><b>Analytics</b>  services for visualization and telemetry data</li></ul>

Cloud computing is a delivery model for four service types:

<ul><li>Storage</li>
<li>Compute Power</li>
<li>Analytics</li>
<li>Networking</li></ul>

##### Key concepts

<ul><li><b>Scalability</b> - the ability to scale, so allocate and deallocate resources at any time</li>
<li><b>Elasticity</b> - the ability to scale dynamically</li>
<li><b>Agility</b> - the ability to react fast (scale quickly)</li>
<li><b>Fault Tolerance</b> - the ability to maintain system uptime while physical and service component failures happen</li>
<li><b>Disaster Recovery</b> - the process and design principle which allows a system to recovers from natural or human induced disasters</li>
<li><b>High Availability</b> - the agreed level of operational uptime for the system. It is a simple calculation of system uptime versus whole lifetime of the system.</li>
<li><b>Availability</b> = uptime/(uptime + downtime)</li></ul>

##### SUMMARY

</ul>

### Principles of economies of scale

#### Economies of Scale

The principle of economies of scale states that as the companies grow they become more effective at managing shared operations. Be that HR and hiring, taxes, accounting, internal operations, marketing, big purchases via contracts meaning better discounts, etc. etc.

Because of those, companies can save/earn more which in return allows for reduction in cost of their services to their customers. This is so called â€˜price per unitâ€™.

Itâ€™s not possible to go to 0 because in the end some underlying infrastructure needs to run to provide the services. But the larger the scale the more benefits can be passed to customers.

In fact, in the current scale, Microsoft can already offer multiple services for free due to how small a fraction of the cost it is for them.

### Capital Expenditure (CapEx) vs Operational Expenditure (OpEx) and their differences

#### CapEx vs OpEx

Differences between Capital Expenditure and Operational Expenditure
|| Capital Expenditure | Operational Expenditure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Up front cost | Significant | None |
| Ongoing cost | Low | Based on usage |
| Tax Deduction | Over time | Same year |
| Early Termination | No | Anytime |
| Maintenance | Significant | Low |
| Value over time | Lowers | No change |

### Consumption-based model

#### What is a consumption-based model?

The consumption-based model is a pricing model used in the cloud so that customers are only charged based on their resource usage.

This model is characterized by

<ul>
<li><b>No associated upfront cost</b></li>
<li><b>No wasted resources</b> as such no charges are incurred for unused resources*. Unused in this case is different per service. For instance, blob storage that stores any data is considered to be used, as it consumes the storage space. Virtual Machines that are running consume CPU, memory and other resources even if there isnâ€™t any traffic. Hence they are considered to be used and will incur charges.</li>
<li><b>Pay for what you need</b></li>
<li><b>Stop paying when you donâ€™t</b></li></ul>

<b>Consumption</b> is the virtual metric used to calculate how much each resource (service) in Azure was used. Each service has many smaller metrics that track its consumption to offer best possible pricing model. Those metrics are tracked on very granular level.

### IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and their differences

#### Service Models responsibilities

As a service means which party will manage the particular layer and all the layers below.

<ul><li>Software layer consists the application (application code and set) & the application data</li>
<li>Platform layer means all the supporting software and the operating system required to host the application</li>
<li>Infrastructure layer consists hardware the infrastructure and virtualization required to host the platform</li></ul>

| Layer            | Layer          |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| Application      | Software       |
| Data             | Software       |
| Runtime          | Platform       |
| Middleware       | Platform       |
| Operating System | Platform       |
| Virtualization   | Infrastructure |
| Servers          | Infrastructure |
| Networking       | Infrastructure |
| Storage          | Infrastructure |

#### Responsibility Matrix

As such following table represents responsibilities
| Layer | On-Premises | IaaS | PaaS | SaaS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Application | You | You | You | Cloud provider |
| Data | You | You | You | Cloud provider |
| Runtime | You | You | Cloud provider | Cloud provider |
| Middleware | You | You | Cloud provider | Cloud provider |
| Operating System | You | You | Cloud provider | Cloud provider |
| Virtualization | You | Cloud provider | Cloud provider | Cloud provider |
| Servers | You | Cloud provider | Cloud provider | Cloud provider |
| Networking | You | Cloud provider | Cloud provider | Cloud provider |
| Storage | You | Cloud provider | Cloud provider | Cloud provider |

### Episode 6: Public, Private, Hybrid cloud and their differences

#### Cloud Deployment Model

<b>Cloud Deployment Model</b> is simple a separation which describes where are the company resources deployed. Whenever this is in public cloud provider environment or private datacenter.

Below table presents high level deployment model separation
