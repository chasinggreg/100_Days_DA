# 100 Days of Data Engineering

[Seattle Data Guy](https://www.youtube.com/@SeattleDataGuy) lays out a [Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a5TMdF7Vz-YdvlHXnNHLMeHk7lV-TdRjbPoxMrQ_cSE/edit?usp=sharing) in his YouTube video [Fastest way to become a Data Engineer in 2024 - 100 Days Of Data Engineering](https://youtu.be/9FVchWw3EbU?si=RPr-GEFkYV0JgW47)

I have updated this Google sheet to Github and have added some content.
