# 100 Days of Data Engineering

---

**100 Days Note**
_100 days is just a little over 3 months and I don't believe 3 months is truly sufficent to "become a data engineer" or at the very least it feels a little fast. There is no need to rush. The real purpose of this 100 days is to get you into the habit of practicing. If aftwards you want to dig into specific subjects, do that! Don't let this 100 days limit you._

| Day 1   | For day one, what I reccomend is taking the time to answering some questions and write out your plan to commit to the next 100 days on social media or somewhere people can help keep you accountable. A discord group, slack, etc. <ol><li>What do you hope to accomplish by the end of the 100 days?</li> <li>Are there any topics you'd like to learn that aren't covered?</li></ol>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Take a moment to write your goals. |

| Day 59  | Take some time to review what you've learned thus far or take some time off! Here are some other things you could do. 1. Write about what you've learned, and what you still don't understand 2. Find a friend who you can teach some of the concepts you've learned(teaching is a great way to learn)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Catch Up and Review                |

| Day 73  | From here, you'll likely need to take this project on yourself. Create a project plan for the next 30 or so days. It doesn't have to take all of the next few days. But really look at this as a time you can learn and try out lots of ideas. But for the most part you'll take on a similar approach. Set-up your infrastructure, load your data, analyze it, figure out what you'd like to display, etc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Project Planning                   |
