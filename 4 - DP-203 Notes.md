# What is Data Engineering ?

Data engineering refers to the practice of designing, building, and managing data solutions. It encompasses a wide range of activities aimed at efficiently processing, storing, and analyzing data to extract valuable insights and drive informed decision-making.

Key components of Azure data engineering include:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Capturing and importing data from various sources such as databases, files, streaming platforms, and IoT devices into Azure.
2. **Data Transformation**: Cleaning, enriching, and transforming raw data into a usable format for analysis and reporting.
3. **Data Storage**: Storing and managing data in Azure’s versatile storage solutions, including Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Blob Storage, and Azure SQL Database.
4. **Data Processing**: Using tools like Azure Databricks, Azure HDInsight, and Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL Data Warehouse) to process and analyze large volumes of data.
5. **Data Integration**: Integrating data from disparate sources to create a unified view for analysis, often involving tools like Azure Data Factory.
6. **Data Orchestration**: Orchestrating and automating data workflows, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and data movement between different components.
7. **Data Warehousing**: Designing and managing data warehouses for structured data storage, querying, and reporting using services like Azure Synapse Analytics.
8. **Streaming Analytics**: Processing and analyzing real-time data streams for immediate insights and actions using services like Azure Stream Analytics.
9. **Machine Learning and AI**: Integrating machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities to derive predictive and prescriptive insights from data.
10. **Data Governance and Security**: Implementing security measures, access controls, and data governance policies to ensure data privacy, compliance, and quality.

## The Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure Certification (DP-203): A Brief Overview:

1. **Get started with data engineering on Azure**

The data engineer will often work with multiple types of data like structured, semi-structured, unstructured data to perform many operations as per requirement.

**Data lakes** are a core element of data analytics architectures. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 provides a scalable, secure, cloud-based solution for data lake storage.

**Azure Synapse Analytics** — a cloud-based platform for big data processing and analysis. It provides a cloud platform for all of these analytical workloads through support for multiple data storage, processing, and analysis technologies in a single, integrated solution.

2. **Build data analytics solutions using Azure Synapse serverless SQL pools**

If you are having large amount of data to analyze then Azure Synapse Analytics enables you to apply the SQL skills you use in a relational database to files in a data lake.

By Leveraging a serverless SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics, you can use the SQL language to transform data in files in a data lake.

Learn and Practice Securing data and manage users in Azure Synapse serverless SQL pools. [Study Material Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/build-data-analytics-solutions-using-azure-synapse-serverless-sql-pools/)

3. **Perform data engineering with Azure Synapse Apache Spark Pools**

You need to understand Analyse, Visualize and transform data using Apache Spark pools in Azure Synapse Analytics.

Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer for Spark that enables relational database capabilities for batch and streaming data. By using Delta Lake, you can implement a data lakehouse architecture in Spark to support SQL_based data manipulation semantics with support for transactions and schema enforcement.
